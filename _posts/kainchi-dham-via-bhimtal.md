Kainchi Dham was established in 1964 by Neem Karoli Baba, one of India's
most revered saints, known for his teachings of love, compassion, and
service to humanity. The name 'Kainchi,' meaning 'scissors' in Hindi, is
derived from the two sharp hairpin turns near the ashram on the
Nainital-Almora road.

Neem Karoli Baba, affectionately called Maharaj-ji by his devotees,
envisioned Kainchi Dham as a place where people from all walks of life
could seek spiritual solace. He believed in the transformative power of
seva (selfless service) and bhakti (devotion), and these principles are
the foundation of the ashram’s teachings.

Today, Kainchi Dham remains a vibrant spiritual center, welcoming
thousands of visitors annually who come to meditate, reflect, and
connect with Maharaj-ji’s teachings.
